# Statement on AI Assistance

Some parts of this project (design suggestions, draft code, and explanations of linux kernel) were created with the assistance of open-source AI tools (Perplexity AI and ChatGPT).

However, the overall system design, code integration, testing, improvements, and documentation were planned and executed by me, Aditya Dubey.  
All AI-generated code was studied, adapted to fit project requirements, and manually corrected or extended when necessary.  
This process helped accelerate my learning of Linux driver and kernel concepts.
