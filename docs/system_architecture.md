# Linux Device Driver Code Evaluation System - Architecture

## Overview
A comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing AI-generated Linux device driver code quality.

## System Components

### 1. Static Code Analyzer (`src/analyzers/static_analyzer.py`)
- Performs compilation checks
- Analyzes security vulnerabilities
- Validates kernel coding standards
- Checks for proper kernel API usage

### 2. Metrics Engine (`src/metrics/evaluation_metrics.py`)
- Weighted scoring system
- Category-based evaluation
- Configurable thresholds

### 3. AI Integration (`src/ai_integration/model_client.py`)
- OpenAI API integration
- Mock client for testing
- Rate limiting and error handling

### 4. Evaluation Pipeline (`ai_evaluation_pipeline.py`)
- Automated testing workflow
- Batch evaluation capability
- Report generation

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Compilation (40%) - Syntax and build success
2. Functionality (25%) - Required driver components
3. Security (20%) - Memory safety and input validation
4. Code Quality (10%) - Style and maintainability
5. Advanced Features (5%) - Optimization and best practices
